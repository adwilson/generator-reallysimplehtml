# Really Simple HTML generator

Let's you quickly setup a really really basic HTML file with nothing more than a basic structure and a few meta tags.

To use you need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/download/) and [yo](http://yeoman.io/learning/index.html) installed.

Then install the generator:
````
npm install -g generator-reallysimplehtml
````

`cd` into your chosen directory or create one with `mkdir`. Then run:
````
yo reallysimplehtml
````

**And your all done!**
